You don’t have to spend hours on a plane to explore wonderful coves, crystal clear waters all while keeping the little ones entertained. Majorca is nothing more than a couple of hours from the UK and with that comes plenty of attractions and more. There is no shortage of waterparks here such as Aqualand or the Western Water Park, all of which guarantee hours of fun. Palma Aquarium is certain to be a hit with the children and if they want something more exciting and adventurous then the caves at Coves d’Arta are always a hit with families.

Canada has it all, from bustling cities to expansive wilderness and amazing wildlife too, so no wonder it’s a popular choice for families. Head to Toronto or Quebec and you can spend the day sightseeing and discovering the famous CN Tower or Chateau Frontenac. If you want beaches, then you might prefer to explore Vancouver where you can embrace the golden sands and allow the kids to run wild for hours on end. However, children love animals, so why not book a wildlife safari or even a whale spotting tour?

### **4. Wonderful Koh Yao Noi, Thailand with the Children**

Thailand is often associated with backpackers and those on an around-the-world trip, but this wonderful country has lots to offer. This destination is perfect for that relaxed escape where children can explore a wealth of water sports and activities or simply relax on the beach. This might not be the ideal trip for children under 10 but if they are older than ten, they will see this destination as one giant playground!

### **5. Discover the Amazing Dordogne, France**

France certainly has it all covered when it comes to a family holiday but when you head to the southwest of France, we recommend you stay in the Dordogne. This stunning part of France is packed with castles, forts, and chateau’s while there are plenty of parks and sites to discover. If that is not enough, hire a canoe and spend the whole day canoeing down the Dordogne River, stopping off at the many riverbanks along the way to soak up the views and enjoy a delicious picnic.

### **6. The Wonders of Bulgaria**

Bulgaria is nothing but fun and sun during the summer months which is why it’s a hit with families. It has everything you could ever want in close proximity which makes it easy to get around. Sunny Beach is the most popular resort and here you will find a lively promenade with plenty of atmosphere and entertainment that will keep the children entertained. Nessebar is also worth a visit as there are Medieval ruins and temples to explore while there are waterparks and plenty of water sports to try out too.

### **7. Disneyland, Florida**

For the ultimate escape with the children, then Disneyland, Florida is a must-visit. The weather is great all year round but there is no shortage of things to do. There are six parks in total to explore, which means you can discover the amazing animals at the Animal Kingdom and rub shoulders with Mickey and friends at the Magic Kingdom. There are plenty of rides for children of all ages while the Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon water parks are packed with waves, slides and adrenaline packed rides.

### **8. Disneyland, Paris**

If the trip across the Atlantic doesn’t appeal, then you could always head to Paris and explore Disneyland there. It contains all the same magic as Disneyland Florida but it’s more manageable when travelling with younger children. There is the Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios both of which will leave your children mesmerised and captivated. If you want top rides, lots of excitement and fun, then Disneyland Paris is the perfect choice.

### **9. A Long Family Break to New Zealand**

The bustling cities are exciting for kids while the culture ensures that this becomes a long holiday you won't forget.

### **10. Relax in Greece**

With sleepy villages, lively beaches and plenty of activities, your children will have the best holiday experience in Greece.

## **The Best Time to Travel with Kids**

Naturally, the best time to travel is during the school holidays. This ensures that your child is not missing important school time. However, if you want to maximise your days and your time then the Spring and Summer months are going to offer more. This is because the weather is going to be better, and you will have more daylight which means that you can cram even more into your time!
