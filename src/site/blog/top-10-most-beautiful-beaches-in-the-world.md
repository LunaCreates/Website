## **Top 10 most beautiful beaches in the world**

Many of the pins on our maps have been inspired by the urge to escape to a faraway deserted island beach. We've been lucky to experience some of these first hand (and some are on the wish list!), so thought we would share these with you which may inspire your next getaway. Here are our top 10 most beautiful beaches in the world.

#### **1.) The Pass Byron Bay, Australia**

The Pass is a gorgeous beach with white sand and long clear waves perfect for surf breaks, dolphin or whale sightings and sunset strolls.

It’s an idyllic place to laze away the day, overlooked by Cape Byron lighthouse built in 1901.

#### **2.) Lucky Bay, Esperance, South Coast of Western Australia**

Located in the Cape Le Grand National Park the bay is known for its bright white sands and turquoise coloured waters.

While exploring the south coast of Australia in 1802, Matthew Flinders sailed a dangerous route through the Recherche Archipelago. He named Lucky Bay when his vessel HMS Investigator took shelter there from a summer storm.

The sheltered bay is ideal for swimming, snorkelling, fishing and surfing, and you may be lucky enough to meet one of the friendly kangaroos chilling on the beach :)

#### **3.) French Polynesia - Bora Bora Lagoon**

Bora Bora is a small South Pacific island northwest of Tahiti in French Polynesia and is one of the world’s most beautiful islands.

The stunning lagoon reflects every shade of blue thanks to its exceptionally clear waters and expansive sandy bottom.

The warm sea feels like a spa, with colourful fish darting beneath you and flower-scented breezes.

Bora Bora is one of the few places on earth that everyone hopes to witness in their lifetime and once you see it, you are forever enamoured.

#### **4.) Carlisle Bay, Antigua**

A quiet cove with white powder sand and turquoise water with a backdrop of an emerald green rain forest.

This is a haven for relaxation and water sports with the calm Caribbean waters and the most amazing sunsets.

Be sure to take a glass-bottom boat trip to see all the incredible shipwrecks and swim with turtles.

#### **5.) Anse Lazio, Praslin, Seychelles**

One of the most beautiful beaches in the world, with turquoise water, white sand, lofty palm trees and impressive granite formations. Perfect for sunbathing, swimming and snorkelling.

This is one of the most untouched, cared for and naturally beautiful places on earth.

#### **6.) Lily Beach, Maldives**

This private beach is pure paradise, with crystal clear waters and beautiful soft white sand. The coral reefs are stunning and perfect for snorkelling.

I highly recommend taking a fishing boat trip to see the sunset, it's truly magical and a trip to swim with the gentle whale sharks is an experience that you will never forget. At night the beach glows with the tiny baby crabs coming in from the warm waters and looks so beautiful and feeding the baby sharks at the end of the pier is also fun entertainment!

The perfect location for a honeymoon or romantic break away.

#### **7.) Soliman Bay, Mexico**

This off-the-beaten-track beach destination has remained Riviera Maya’s best-kept secret. The secluded beach is perfect for a lazy day under a palm tree or taking a snorkel of the beautiful reef.

White silky sands with a calm turquoise sea, this beach is the ideal destination for families with children.

You can paddleboard or kayak out onto the reef, where there is excellent snorkelling and an array of colourful fish.

#### **8.) Pansea Beach, Thailand**

The secluded beach is located just next to Surin on the west coast of Phuket, there is a hidden path leading down to the beach.

Once you arrive you will be rewarded with a superb beach with soft white sand and an incredible crystal clear aqua sea.

Pansea is one of the best beaches in Phuket and is the perfect beach destination if you are looking for a romantic getaway.

#### **9.) Elafonisi Beach, Crete**

Elafonisi is a magical place that consists of a small islet of pink coral sandy beaches and crystal clear waters in the turquoise lagoon. Voted as one of the most majestic beaches in the world.

The waters are shallow so ideal for families with small children.

You can reach the Elafonisi island by foot where you will find a protected nature reserve with a variety of birds, amphibians and reptiles including the Balkan Green Lizard which is meant to bring good luck! This is also the nesting area for the beloved Caretta-caretta sea turtles.

#### **10.) Havelock Island, Andaman Islands**

India’s most beautiful secret!

Premium scuba diving and snorkelling are the highlights of the gorgeous Havelock Island.

Seven tranquil beaches are practically untouched by the tourist trail, famous for its swimming elephants and unbeatable reef.

Activities offered include an underwater sea walk, Jet Skiing, glass-bottom boats and scuba diving.

A perfect place to spend some peaceful time in the lap of nature and enjoy some of the cleanest beaches on the planet.
