The world is changing so fast, people are starting to move away from choosing their holiday destinations via the traditional high street travel agent and instead navigating towards travel influencers to discover new and exciting places to visit in this incredible world.

This is why we wanted to share with you those who have given us inspiration over the years and thought they could provide great ideas for your next trip.

These are some of our favourites:-

Lauren’s advice to people considering going travelling full time is to _‘Learn to roll with the punches and never plan too much. You never know who you’re going to meet or where opportunities are going to take you’_, and her favourite quote is _‘I would rather own a little and see the world than own the world and see a little of it’._

This is a family of travelling journalists who have travelled to over 85 countries!

In 2015 they set out as a family for a few months of travel, those few months turned into years.

When they took off they created a small bucket list : swim with whales and lived like locals in different countries of the world. Over the years their bucket list continued to grow and grow.

Slept in castles, ate breakfast with Giraffes and explored the world from above and below.

_"The thing about a bucket list, it does not need to be a list at all, it’s about living life with purpose, realising that there are special bucket list experiences waiting to be had each and everyday of your life._

_For us these moments have made us brave, encouraged us to try new things and help us be more open minded, open hearted and grateful for when they come along._

_Hopefully your moments will do the same._

_Bucket List experiences come in all shapes and sizes, everyday adventures in your own backyard and brave new journeys around the world.”_
