The chance to go whale watching at Hermanus is phenomenal and could well be the highlight of your time in South Africa. If not then settling for hiking across the Table Mountain National Park, sampling the Umi and Paranga beaches at Camp’s Bay, or enjoying a romantic road trip across The Garden Route will have to suffice. Wash it all down with one of the many Vinyard offerings by tasting some of South Africa’s finest wine.

With significant tourist attractions in Durban, Kruger National Park, Cape Town, Johannesburg, South Africa has a vast depth of culture to explore, not to mention the sublime weather and immense safari options.

## Dubai

Treating yourself to not just 5 but 7 stars of luxury and being treated like royalty sounds appealing. This is achievable in all the opulence and glamour of Burj Al Arab where many A-listers from the corporate and celebrity world mix and relax in their leisure time. There are many other luxurious options of course and this up-and-coming dynamic City can even be treated as a vibrant city break rather than an entire vacation.

Dubai seems to be the epicentre of everything at the moment and is certainly a plausible reason to honeymoon there. Its growth and development into one of the most lucrative and attractive places on earth is certainly iconic and draws people in. Outstanding in its own right, Dubai is also perfectly suited to combine a two-centre honeymoon with surrounding areas to really cap off a special holiday for you and your partner.

Linking up with Abu Dhabi, The Maldives, Sri Lanka amongst others offers prospective double or even mind-blowing triple destination honeymoon extravaganzas if you wish. The beauty of Dubai being so international and a hub of travel is that nothing is impossible and everything is on the table if you want it.
