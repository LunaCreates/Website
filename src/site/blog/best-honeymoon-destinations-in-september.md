If you are unsure where to go on your honeymoon in September then a fantastic place would be Australia, particularly Sydney. September in Sydney is a lot cooler and usually averages around the 15-20° Celsius mark which makes sightseeing a lot more bearable. There are so many amazing places to stay which will be the icing on the cake of your fun-filled and action-packed trip to one of the world’s greatest cities. Choose from Ferntree Rainforest Lodge or Kangaroo Island Seafront for the ultimate honeymoon base in Australia.
